# Info-Project
Hello, and welcome to CupcakeStudios.\
Our newest game, `CupcakeSpaceExploitation`, is a game where you can slip into the boots of an agent of a grand corporation and exploit planets and labour for resources. (This aspect is sadly not yet explored and build upon in the game, but will perhaps be addeted in upcoming updates).
## Some Gerneral Information
### Why was this Project created?
It was created as a part of a school project and its main focus was to show what we had learned, to develope new skills and to show them off.
### Status of the Project
Due to the nature of a school project we had a limited timeframe to develope the game, and so this game is far from finished. Many lines of code were allready written, but are not yet uesd and therefor not accessible for the player. We are working hard on fixing that.
### Where to view the source-code
[here](https://github.com/PolterSkun/Info-Project/tree/44c1d42aed0b110c4e5c86217ca80b0c8bea3ed7/Assets/Scrips)\
For clarity reasons we divided our scripts into 2 folders: ui and notui.
### How to view all the stuff in Unity
We used the Unity Version `Unity Version "2023.2.3f1"` to creat this project, so if you want to view all the stuff that was done in Unity itself, you can download the version we used [here](https://unity.com/ja/releases/editor/whats-new/2023.2.3)


### How to play
You can find the build for our game, `CupcakeSpaceExploitation`, [here]() (does not yet work :( ). Though be warned: This project is far from finished and is subject to many bugs. Futhermore it is NOT feature complete. In fact the main gamplay-loop is not yet accessible for the player to enjoy.

### Problems 

The biggets problem we had to face, was learning C#, since all of us had little to no experience with it. But with the help of Tutorials, experienced people and the smiliarity to other programmiung languages, out team adapted really quickly. Another problem was time mangement, because we had a tight schedule and maybe procrastinated a bit. The last and smallest problem we had was exporting our project. If not experienced enough that can cause issues such as UI bugs or our game not being optimized enough.

### final Class diagram
In the development-phase we realised that our first idea was completly wrong and our project was going to be much larger\
