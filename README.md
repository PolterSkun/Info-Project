# Info-Project
Hello, this is our first programming project in school, which is bigger than a few lines of code.\

## Why was this Project created?

## How to view the source-code in Unity yourself
First, open git bash and input the following line:\
`git clone https://github.com/PolterSkun/Info-Project.git`\
This creats a clone of the project on your PC.\
The Unity version that we used to creat the Game is "", which you may download [here]().\
